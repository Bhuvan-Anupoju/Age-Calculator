# ðŸ§® Age Calculator 

#### ðŸ”°overview
- This is a simple and interactive Age Calculator web application where users can enter their birth date and instantly calculate their exact age. The application provides a clear and user-friendly interface, allowing users to easily input their date of birth. Once submitted, it dynamically calculates and displays the user's age in years, months, and days.

- The web app is built using HTML to structure the content, CSS to style the layout and ensure responsiveness across devices, and JavaScript to handle the logic and perform real-time age calculations based on the current date. It also includes basic validation to manage invalid or future date inputs, making it reliable and user-friendly.
